Do we want to split user into normal or dj?
Do we want to introduce a dj queue?

"The free queue should be sorted based on the time the user signed up; first in, first out. The accelerated queue should be able to be sorted in either time order
or by the amount paid. Make sure to implement some mechanism to switch the sort order.": Do we want to split up request queue or just put more information in it?
